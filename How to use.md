# VisionAI
Vision AI, developed by Team Dev Terminators, is an innovative AI system designed to empower physically challenged individuals by enabling seamless interaction with laptops, desktops, and entertainment systems. Our solution allows users to control their entire computer through voice commands and text-based interactions, making technology more accessible and inclusive. By integrating problem-solving skills through voice-to-voice communication, Vision AI enhances learning experiences and boosts user confidence. We have also developed Vision AI as a standalone application for ease of use. The intuitive user interface, built using Qt Creator, ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience, while the entire system is powered by Python for efficiency and reliability. Team members Ashlin John J, Eramiya Vimalanathan, Barath, and Arunachalam have collaboratively worked on this project to create an impactful and inclusive technology. To use the system, simply open the Vision AI app, and all functionalities will be ready to use.
